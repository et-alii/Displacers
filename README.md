## Introduction


This project consists of a mathematical model of the movement of a sphere on an irregular surface in order to output a graphical, bidimensional visualization of how its trajectory would look from a given point.

For it, the main function requires from the user two basic parameters:
- The terrain over which the displacer will move. 
- The coordinates (px, py) of the initial position of the displacer.

Other specifications as the initial speed, gravitational acceleration value, coefficient of friction, etc. can optionally be modified by the user. 

The obtained visualization will show the user the sphere movements in the axis x, and y by left-right and up-down movements, and the movements over the z-axis will be represented by the color of the pixel in the provided image where a value of 0 will represent the lowest point in the terrain and the value 255 the highest.

## Objetives

- Generate a model of the movement of a sphere on an irregular surface.
- Create a graphical visualization of the model from the provided parameters.

## Acceleration function
We know that the formula to calculate acceleration is $a = F/m$, however, by having the object on an inclined surface, its weight is divided into 2 forces: one on the $X$ axis and another on the $Y$ axis.
The angle of inclination of the surface is the same angle formed between the force in the $Y$ axis and the weight of the object, therefore if we move the vector of the force in $X$ in a parallel way, we will have the necessary trigonometry to obtain the forces:

$Fx = P * sin𝛳$

$Fy = P * cos𝛳$, if we substitute the weight for: $P = m * g$: 
$Fx = m * g * sin𝛳$ y  $Fy = m * g * cos𝛳$

In addition to the previous decomposition there is a force that arises from $Fy$ that exists due to friction with the surface, called friction force $(Ff)$. The movement will depend on this force, because if $Ff$ is greater than the angle of inclination of the surface $(𝛳)$, the object will remain at rest; likewise, if $Ff$ is less than $𝛳$, then the body will descend with a uniformly accelerated motion.

The maximum value that $Ff$ can have is given by $μ = Ff/Fy$, where solving for $Ff$ we have that $Ff = μ * Fy = μ * m * g * cos𝛳$, therefore, if we want there to be movement we look for $Fx = Ff$ .

Substituting $Fx$ and $Ff$ we have:

$m * g * sin𝛳 = μ * m * g * cos𝛳$, simplifying the equation:

$sin𝛳 = μ * cos𝛳$.

The trig ratio relating $sin𝛳$ and $cos𝛳$ is $tan𝛳$, therefore:

$μ = tan𝛳$ and $𝛳 = arctan μ$

The resultant force of the two forces acting on the object is:

$FR = m * g * sin𝛳 – μ * m * g * cos𝛳 = m * g * (sin𝛳 – μ * cos𝛳)$

Finally, the fundamental principle of dynamics is applied: 

$a = F/m$

$a = m * g * (sin𝛳 – μ * cos𝛳) / m$

Simplify and we have:

$a = g * (sin𝛳 – μ * cos𝛳)$
