## Introduction


This project consists of a mathematical model of the movement of a sphere on an irregular surface in order to output a graphical, bidimensional visualization of how its trajectory would look from a given point.

For it, the main function requires from the user two basic parameters:
- The terrain over which the displacer will move. 
- The coordinates (px, py) of the initial position of the displacer.

Other specifications as the initial speed, gravitational acceleration value, coefficient of friction, etc. can optionally be modified by the user. 

The obtained visualization will show the user the sphere movements in the axis x, and y by left-right and up-down movements, and the movements over the z-axis will be represented by the color of the pixel in the provided image where a value of 0 will represent the lowest point in the terrain and the value 255 the highest.

## Objectives

- Generate a model of the movement of a sphere on an irregular surface.
- Create a graphical visualization of the model from the provided parameters.
## Metodology
### Mathematical Formulas
For the calculations two formulas were required.

#### Acceleration function
We know that the formula to calculate acceleration is $a = F/m$, however, by having the object on an inclined surface, its weight is divided into 2 forces: one on the $X$ axis and another on the $Y$ axis.
The angle of inclination of the surface is the same angle formed between the force in the $Y$ axis and the weight of the object, therefore if we move the vector of the force in $X$ in a parallel way, we will have the necessary trigonometry to obtain the forces:
![Image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60940990/206359851-b574ad10-6b31-4708-b05f-0421e5084f1c.gif)
$Fx = P * sinùõ≥$

$Fy = P * cosùõ≥$, if we substitute the weight for: $P = m * g$: 
$Fx = m * g * sinùõ≥$ y  $Fy = m * g * cosùõ≥$

In addition to the previous decomposition there is a force that arises from $Fy$ that exists due to friction with the surface, called friction force $(Ff)$. The movement will depend on this force, because if $Ff$ is greater than the angle of inclination of the surface $(ùõ≥)$, the object will remain at rest; likewise, if $Ff$ is less than $ùõ≥$, then the body will descend with a uniformly accelerated motion.

The maximum value that $Ff$ can have is given by $Œº = Ff/Fy$, where solving for $Ff$ we have that $Ff = Œº * Fy = Œº * m * g * cosùõ≥$, therefore, if we want there to be movement we look for $Fx = Ff$ .

Substituting $Fx$ and $Ff$ we have:

$m * g * sinùõ≥ = Œº * m * g * cosùõ≥$, simplifying the equation:

$sinùõ≥ = Œº * cosùõ≥$.

The trig ratio relating $sinùõ≥$ and $cosùõ≥$ is $tanùõ≥$, therefore:

$Œº = tanùõ≥$ and $ùõ≥ = arctan Œº$

The resultant force of the two forces acting on the object is:

$FR = m * g * sinùõ≥ ‚Äì Œº * m * g * cosùõ≥ = m * g * (sinùõ≥ ‚Äì Œº * cosùõ≥)$

Finally, the fundamental principle of dynamics is applied: 

$a = F/m$

$a = m * g * (sinùõ≥ ‚Äì Œº * cosùõ≥) / m$

Simplify and we have:

$a = g * (sinùõ≥ ‚Äì Œº * cosùõ≥)$

#### Matrix angles

Performs a three-dimensional linear regression on a matrix, it uses matrix horizontal indices scaled by $hscale$ as values for $x$, vertical indices scaled by $hscale$ as values for $y$ and matrix values scaled by $vscale$ as values for $z$, setting $z$  as the dependent variable and $x, y$ as independent variables.  It computes the slope of $x$ against $z$ and the slope of $y$ against $z$, and returns the inverse tangents of both slopes to obtain corresponding angles.

The values $hscale$ and $vscale$ represent the appropriate scale for the entered terrain.

In order to obtain the angles the next formula was applied in the linear regression.

$\theta = \arctan \frac{\Sigma i d - (\Sigma i \Sigma d) \div n}{\Sigma i i  -  (\Sigma i \Sigma i)\div n}$ 

Where $i$ is the independent variable and $d$ the dependent one.

### Computational implementation

For the implementation of this project six functions were created:

- `ss`: Returns the sum of cross products of two equal-lenght arrays `a` and `b`.
- `submatrix`: Given an input `matrix`, returns a submatrix of size 2`r`+1 by 2`r`+1
    with center in (`cx`, `cy`). If it is not possible to form a submatrix from
    the given conditions (e.g. when `cx` and/or `cy` are close to the borders),
    a trimmed matrix is returned.
- `matrix_angles`: Performs a three-dimensional linear regression on an input `matrix`. In
    particular, it uses matrix horizontal indices scaled by `hscale` as values
    for x, vertical indices scaled by `hscale` as values for y, and matrix
    values scaled by `vscale` as values for z, setting z as the dependent
    variable and x, y as independent variables. It computes the slope of x
    against z, and the slope of y against z, and returns the inverse tangents of
    both slopes to obtain corresponding angles.
- `acelerations`: Given a three-dimensional inclination, return the acceleration (in x and y)
    produced by the force of gravity. If no custom gravity is specified, the
    function will use Earth's Standard Gravity. You can also set a coefficient
    of friction, which by default is 0.
- `next_state`: Returns the new position and velocity of the displacer in the x and y
    components given a previous state as well as the accelerations calculated
    with the `accelerations` function.
- `iterate`: Main function of the displacer simulation. The only required arguments are:
    the `terrain` over which the displacer will move, and the coordinates (`px`
    and `py`) of the initial position of the displacer. By default, the function
    returns a list of dictionaries with the states on every iteration, unless
    the `return_all` parameter is set to `False`. The dictionaries produced by
    this functions contain four keys, `px`, `py`, `vx` and `vy`, corresponding
    to the location and speed of the displacer at any given moment.
